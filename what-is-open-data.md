# What is Open Data?


**Data** are electronic records stored in computer systems. In the simplest terms, data are lists of things such as requests for service, inventories, or incidents, which include helpful details such as dates, locations, images, video, and more.

**Open data** makes these electronic records accessible in whole or in part to the public. This practice is considered proactive disclosure making information available without being requested. While industry experts often refer to the [Eight Principles of Open Data](http://opengovdata.org/), these four are the most important:
* Open data is **online**. Cities provide open data through the internet. The public is able to find and use open data without waiting for a response or approval.
* Open data is **free**. Cities do not require payment from anyone to obtain open data. This does not mean that cities cannot charge for data, however.
* Open data is **non-proprietary**. Cities do not require data consumers to have specific software programs in order to use open data. 
* Open data is **unrestricted**. Cities do not restrict the use, interpretation, or redistribution of open data through copyright or other terms of use.

As long as the data is not limited by privacy considerations, it may become open and freely accessed, used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.
